# AQQA
small sqlite database
RBAIE = cold water bathroom
RBUC=   cold water kitchen  
CBAIE = hot water bathroom
CBUC=   hot water kitchen
calculeaza = compute the changes
ADD= add to the database ( after compute changes current month vs past month)
DEL = delete the last row but need to restart the application to see the changes, need to implement something to refresh the db
It works in Qt5, Qt6 under Win,Linux, and even ANDROID lol but the gui is very ugly in android and dont fit well, but db works
Maybe is usefull for someone _ have fun!!!
